    "The data provided was in separate CSV files for each participant, with each record representing the participant's turn and the corresponding features. The train folder contained 87 files, while the test folder had 20 files. To simplify the process, all CSVs from the train folder were combined into a single file. The participant ID was extracted from the CSV file name and added as a feature to the consolidated data. The \"labels.csv\" file was used to map the participant ID to their corresponding gender and depression labels. The test data underwent a similar treatment. As a result, two files were generated: \"final_training_data\" with 13,625 records and 91 columns, and \"final_testing_data\" with 3,280 records and 91 columns. In addition to the 88 audio features provided, three columns were added: \"participant_id,\" \"gender,\" and \"depression\"."

    "After experimenting with both Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN) and Random Forest Classifier (RF), we decided to model the Depression classification using Random Forest due to its ease of interpretability and faster processing speed. Although the FNN had a slight advantage in terms of accuracy, the Random Forest Classifier proved to be a more suitable choice for this particular task, offering a balance between performance and practicality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward with this choice, we used a Randomized Search CV to identify the best hyperparameters for the Random Forest Classifier. Our goal for this optimization was to reduce overfitting the model, so we chose hyperparameters that would help us attain this objective. We selected n_estimators, max_features, max_depth, and min_samples_split. Increasing the number of trees can help reduce overfitting by creating a more diverse ensemble. By limiting the number of features, the Random Forest is forced to focus on the most informative features and reduces the chances of overfitting to noise or irrelevant features. Limiting the depth of the trees helps in controlling their complexity and prevents them from growing too deep and overfitting to the training data. Increasing min_samples_split prevents the trees from splitting on very small subsets of data, which can be prone to overfitting. However, it is important to note that increasing or decreasing these hyperparameters beyond a certain point can be detrimental to the model's training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the best hyperparameters for our Random Forest Classifier, we employed the Repeated Stratified K Fold Cross Validation technique in conjunction with RandomizedSearchCV. This approach helps us avoid obtaining a noisy estimate of the model's performance, which can happen when different splits of the data lead to vastly different results. By using RepeatedStratifiedKFold, we can improve the estimated performance of our machine learning model through a simple yet effective method. The cross-validation procedure is repeated multiple times, and the mean result across all folds from all runs is reported. This mean result serves as a more accurate and reliable estimate of the model's true performance, as it takes into account the variability that can occur due to different data splits."

    "The overall test accuracy of 0.7 indicates that the classifier correctly predicts the presence or absence of depression in 70% of the test samples. However, the balanced accuracy of 0.5 suggests that the classifier's performance is not consistent across the two classes (depression and no depression). A balanced accuracy of 0.5 is equivalent to random guessing, implying that the classifier is not effectively distinguishing between the two classes. One possible reason for this could be that the model is overfitting. We see our validation accuracy to be around 84%, while our prediction accuracy is only 70%, indicating that the model might be overfitting on the train data.\n",

    "When we look at the gender-specific results, we see a significant disparity between male and female accuracy. The classifier achieves a high accuracy of 0.917 for male participants, meaning it correctly identifies the presence or absence of depression in 91.7% of the male test samples. In contrast, the accuracy for female participants is only 0.375, indicating that the classifier correctly identifies depression in only 37.5% of the female test samples. The balanced accuracy for both male and female participants is 0.5, which aligns with the overall balanced accuracy.\n",

In this case, the EO value of 0.458 suggests a substantial difference in the classifier's ability to correctly identify depression in males versus females.\n",

    "The accuracies are evaluated based on the different number of selected features. It shows that with 10,15 features accuracy, balanced accuracy is lowest and EO is highest. For all the other different number of features, the accuracy, balanced accuracy and EO is the same. The accuracy improves from 0.65 to 0.7 as the number of features increases from 15 to 20. This suggests that the additional five features included between these two points provide meaningful information that enhances the model’s predictive capabilities. The extra features beyond the first 20 do not contribute additional predictive value. Let's visualize how the performance shifts with increasing the features."

    "The results obtained after applying sample weights to mitigate bias in the depression classification model show that the accuracies remain similar to those of the original model. This suggests that the sample re-weighting approach has minimal impact on improving the model's performance and fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible explanation for the limited effectiveness of sample re-weighting is that the dataset used for training the model may not be significantly biased towards one gender. Although the dataset contains more male samples than female samples, the difference in the number of samples between the two genders is not substantial. In such cases, re-weighting the samples to achieve equal representation of both genders may not yield significant improvements in the model's performance or fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the robustness of the random forest classifier to changes in sample weighting could also contribute to the observed results. Random forest is an ensemble algorithm that combines multiple decision trees, each trained on a subset of the data and features, to make predictions. This ensemble nature allows random forest to handle imbalanced datasets and reduce the impact of individual biased samples, making it less sensitive to the changes introduced by sample re-weighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that the lack of significant improvement in accuracies after applying sample weights does not necessarily imply that the model is unbiased. The model may still exhibit disparities in performance between male and female participants, as evidenced by the Equality of Opportunity (EO) value of 0.458 reported in the previous analysis."
